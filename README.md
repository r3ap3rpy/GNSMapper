### This garage project is about drawing topology of devices based on established TCP connections!

The idea came to be when I wanted to visualize the devices and their relative positions at my workplace of that time.

We had no tools and nothing to be used as a guide, so I thought to myself I have ansible/python/GNS... what can go wrong. :)

So the ansible is used to get connected clients of a specific tcp socket, then a GNS file is generated wich serves as a topology that can be drawn up!
